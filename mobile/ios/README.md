# Allora MLX iOS App

A native iOS application for managing Allora worker nodes and running ML models on-device using Apple's MLX framework.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **On-Device ML Inference** - Run models directly on iPhone/iPad using MLX
- ðŸ“Š **Worker Management** - Deploy and monitor Allora workers remotely
- ðŸ’° **Earnings Tracker** - Real-time testnet token monitoring
- ðŸ”„ **Model Conversion** - Convert and optimize models for Core ML
- ðŸ“± **Native Performance** - Optimized for Apple Silicon (A-series chips)

## Requirements

- iOS 16.0+ / iPadOS 16.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Apple Developer Account (for device testing)
- macOS 14.0+ (for development)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/allora-enhanced-deployment.git
   cd allora-enhanced-deployment/mobile/ios
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open AlloraMLX.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Configure signing**
   - Select the project in Xcode
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Select your development team
   - Xcode will create provisioning profiles automatically

4. **Build and run**
   - Select your target device (physical device recommended for MLX)
   - Press Cmd+R to build and run

## MLX Integration

The app uses MLX Swift for on-device machine learning:

- **Text Generation** - Using Mistral 7B quantized models
- **Price Prediction** - Custom ensemble models for Allora
- **Model Management** - Download, cache, and update models
